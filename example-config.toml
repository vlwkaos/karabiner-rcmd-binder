# Notes:
# - All bindings use right_command (rcmd) modifier automatically
# - Press rcmd+<key> to trigger the action(s)
# - Multiple actions = cycling behavior (press again to cycle)
# - Single action = direct trigger
# - URL match types:
#   - exact: Full URL must match exactly
#   - domain: Any page on the same domain
#   - path: Domain + path (ignores query params)
#   - glob: Wildcard matching with *
